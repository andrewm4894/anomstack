## Documentation Content
The documentation covers:
- **Quickstart guide** (`docs/docs/quickstart.md`) - Getting started with Anomstack
- **Data source integrations** - BigQuery, ClickHouse, DuckDB, Snowflake, etc.
- **Features** - Alerts, anomaly detection, dashboard, LLM agent
- **Deployment guides** - Docker, GCP, and other deployment options
- **Configuration options** - Environment variables, metrics, hot-reload

## Working with Documentation
