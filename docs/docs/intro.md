# Introduction to Anomstack

Anomstack is an open-source anomaly detection platform that makes it easy to monitor and detect anomalies in your metrics data. Built on top of [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) for orchestration and [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) + [MonsterUI](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/MonsterUI) for the dashboard, Anomstack provides a complete solution for metric monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Key Features

- üîç **Powerful Anomaly Detection**: Built on [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for robust anomaly detection
- üìä **Beautiful Dashboard**: Modern UI for visualizing metrics and anomalies
- üîå **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for various databases and data platforms
- üîî **Flexible Alerting**: Email and Slack notifications with customizable templates
- ü§ñ **LLM Agent Integration**: AI-powered anomaly analysis and reporting
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy Deployment**: Multiple deployment options including Docker, Dagster Cloud, and more

## How It Works

1. **Define Your Metrics**: Configure your metrics using SQL queries or Python functions
2. **Automatic Processing**: Anomstack handles ingestion, training, scoring, and alerting
3. **Monitor & Alert**: Get notified when anomalies are detected
4. **Visualize**: Use the dashboard to explore metrics and anomalies
