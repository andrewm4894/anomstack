# Anomaly Detection

Anomstack uses PyOD (Python Outlier Detection) to detect anomalies in your metrics. This section explains how the anomaly detection works and how to configure it.

## How It Works

Anomstack's anomaly detection process:
1. Ingests metric data
2. Preprocesses the data
3. Trains detection models
4. Scores new data points
5. Identifies anomalies

## Configuration

You can configure anomaly detection through:
- Model selection
- Training parameters
- Scoring thresholds
- Custom preprocessing

## Models

Anomstack supports various anomaly detection models:
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor
- One-Class SVM
- And more...

## Examples
